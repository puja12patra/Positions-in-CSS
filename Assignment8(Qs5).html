<!-- Explain the z-index, with a code example. -->

<body>
    <h1>Z-index</h1>
    <p>The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.</p>
    <h2>Z-index can working are as follows:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.</li>
        <li>z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position: relative, position: fixed, or
            position: sticky)</li>
        <li>flex items (elements that are direct children of display:flex elements).</li>
        <li>If two positioned elements overlap without a z-index specified, the element positioned last in the HTML code
            will be shown on top.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Example of z-index Property</h1>
    <div class="green-box"> </div>
    <div class="pink-box"> </div>
    <div class="blue-box"> </div>
    <p>When working with z-index we need to understand "Positioned elements always come on top".</p>
    <p>z-index only works with positioned elements.<br>We set position: relative on the green box and see the result.</p>
    <p>We see that the green box is now being rendered on top and the browser has re-calculated the stacking context</p>
    <p>Note: This doesn't apply to position: static. This is because position: static is the default positioned value assigned by CSS to all DOM elements. </p>
