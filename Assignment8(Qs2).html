<!-- Explain the difference between Absolute and Relative positioning. -->

<body>
   
        <h2>Relative Positioning:</h2>

        <p>It works with respect to its current position without changing layout or impacting siblings.</p>
        
        <div class="parent1">
            <div class="box" id="one">One</div>
            <div class="box" id="two">Two</div>
            <div class="box" id="three">Three</div>
            <div class="box" id="four">Four</div>
        </div>
       <br><br>
        <p>Here,by applying position: Relative, move the green box relative to its current position to 20px from the
            left and top without changing the layout around it. Thus, leaving a gap for the green box where it would have
            been had it not been position.</p>
        <h2>Absolute Positioning:</h2>

        <p>By Default, it works with respect to its parent and the parent should be relative. If no parent is present, then it uses the document body as
            parent.Do not impact anything of main layer.</p>
   
   
    <div class="parent2">
        <div class="box" id="five">One</div>
        <div class="box" id="six">Two</div>
        <div class="box" id="seven">Three</div>
        <div class="box" id="eight">Four</div>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <p>But in case of Absolute it is opposite of Relative Postision.By applying position: absolute to the GreenBox, it
        will not leave any gap where it would have been. The position
        of the GreenBox is based on its parent position (the dotted border) works with respect to the viewport(body).
        Thus, moving 20px to the left and bottom
        from the top-left origin of the dotted border.</p>
